# CV Creator App

## What is this ?

This project is part of my **Curriculum Series**, the objective is to have a repository to prove my skills as a web developer.

Now that I feel more confident with my javascript it is time to starting working with frameworks.
This App generates a curriculum template from the fields you fill, the goal is to start working with React and for educational purposes, I will be using React class components.

Typescript is now going to be the main language since I want to improve my toolkit and create better code.
